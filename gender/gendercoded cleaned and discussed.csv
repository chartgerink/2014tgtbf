However,the rank-order correlation of criteria prevalences for men and women was quite high ( rs = .96, p< .01),which means that the relative lifetime prevalences of symptoms did not differ by gender.

Under those circumstances, girls and boys alike were more likely to seek access to peers' possessions if they were in the majority ( M = 12.4 vs. M = 8.3 for groups with a majority of and a minority of girls, respectively, and M = 9.9 vs. M = 6.8 for groups with a majority of and a minority of boys, respectively).

This interaction, however, should be interpreted cautiously. Because the experiment was not designed to test for sex effects, the total number of participants is very low in some of the conditions (e.g., only 4 men in the high-power condition), which can result in unstable effects. In addition, although there was no significant interaction between sex of participant and power in Experiment 1, Ï‡ 2(1, N = 32) = 1.76, p =.19, the pattern of data was in the opposite direction, such that women were more affected by the power manipulation than were men.

The cause of the interaction would therefore appear to be boys' greater use of self-regulatory PS in the British sample, coupled with no such gender effect in the Saudi sample. As reported above, levels of self-regulatory PS in this sample were highly correlated with social speech. To determine whether the interaction between nationality and gender was specific to PS or applied to children's speech in general, we conducted the same analyses on social speech measu;3;3;3;0;3;;no expectation

Thus, positive events may not relate as strongly to perceptions and feelings about the relationship as much as negative events ( Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, &amp, Vohs, 2001). As mentioned earlier, gender was included as both a covariate and in an additional step as a potential moderator (e.g., Gender Ã— Actor Autonomy) of the actor and partner associations described above. Two significant gender effects emerged. First, women generally reported less defensiveness, F(1, 64) = 5.81, p < .05, Î² = âˆ’.41. Second, a Gender Ã— Actor Autonomy interaction predicting understanding indicated that the association between actor relationship autonomy and understanding responses was stronger for women (Î² = .72) than for men (Î² = .00), F(1, 102) = 13.84, p < .001, Î² = âˆ’.78.

A near-significant main effect for grade was found, F(3, 378)= 2.25, p< .08, suggesting a tendency for younger children to receive higher ratings than older children. These main effects were qualified by two significant interactions. First, a significant Sex of Target Ã— Sex of Rater interaction, F(1, 378)= 5.72, p< .05, resulted from boys receiving significantly lower scores from girls, than girls received from boys, t(386)= 3.59, p< .01. Thus, greater cross-sex negativity was found among girl raters than boy raters. Second, a significant interaction between sex of rater and grade was obtained, F(3, 378)= 11.15, p< .001. Simple effects tests (ScheffÃ© procedure, p< .05) indicated that this interaction resulted from children receiving significantly lower ratings from cross-sex peers in Grade 3 ( M= 1.88, SD= .41) than in kindergarten ( M= 2.13, SD= .42), Grade 1 ( M= 2.08, SD= .42), and Grade 2 ( M= 2.09, SD= ;3;3;3;0;3;;no expectation

Startle ResponseForty-one controls, 31 PCS0, and 19 PCS2 were tested, about evenly distributed by sex. There was a significant interaction of sex and group on the startle response, F(2, 85) = 5.4, p < .01, because male PCS2 were less startled than male controls ( p < .001) and male PCS0 ( p < .05). There was also an interaction of trials, sex, and group, F(18, 156) = 2.0, p < .05, possibly because males habituated more rapidly than females, while maintaining the sex and group differences.

To increase sensitivity and robustness, and to facilitate interpretability and multivariate classification analysis of fMRI data, we used a median split on the total-anxiety score to divide children into two groups of equal size (HMA group score: M = 38.391, SD = 7.590, LMA group score: M = 25.348, SD = 2.673). The two groups differed on math anxiety but not on IQ, working memory, or overall reading and math proficiency (Table 1). Math-anxiety scores did not differ between boys and girls, F(1, 44) = 1.751, p = .193, or between second and third graders, F(1, 44) = 0.018, p = .894, so data from both genders and grades were pooled for subsequent analysis. Critically, although the two groups differed in math anxiety, F(1, 44) = 60.425, p < .001, they did not differ in trait anxiety, F(1, 39) = 0.508, p = .480.

In contrast, APSD scores were not significantly associated with any of the DASS subscales. RMET scores exhibited a significant positive correlation with predicted IQ. Age showed no significant association with either RMET or APSD score. Independent samples t-tests demonstrated that females and males did not differ significantly on APSD scores (t (89)1.6, p = .113) or on RMET scores (t (44) = -2.00, p = .052).

Together, these results show that women are better at predicting others' gift preferences than men for both female and male targets. This indicates that it is not simply projection which drives the effect of Study 2, but that there is a robust difference in the way men and women p;3;3;3;0;3;;no expectation

Conversely, when men and women feel equally confident about the domain being evaluated, the gender differences should not emerge. Thus, our finding the men and women in Study 2 to report similar levels of confidence in their case-analysis performance before they received negative feedback, Ms = 5.09 and 5.31 for men and women, respectively, F(1, 76) = 0.625, ns, and after they received negative feedback, Ms = 4.23 and 4.76 for men and women, respectively, F(1, 76) = 2.09, ns, may explain why no gender differences were observed in that study. In summary, our findings suggest that although Blacks and Whites may differ in their response to negative feedback and selection procedures, men and women in each racial group may differ in their responses as well. Furthermore, these differential reactions may be due, at least in part, to the individuals' feelings of confidence with regard to the domain being evaluated.These studies are not without limitations;3;1;3;1;1;;null expected

Although there were no overall gender effect, exploratory analyses of variance (ANOVAs) of each process factor separately revealed that the experiential factor was predicted by gender in addition to stage.

The eight standard deviation scores were then averaged for each child, separately for male and female targets. This procedure yielded a measure of perceived variability for targets of each sex. Once again, this measure was analyzed in a 2 (sex of child) Ã— 2 (sex of target) mixed-model ANOVA. Main effects were significant for both sex of child, F(1, 93) = 4.10, p< .05, and sex of target, F(1, 93) = 34.70, p< .0001. However, they were qualified by a significant interaction, F(1, 93) = 4.43, p< .05.
